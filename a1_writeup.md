# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
I think I am still a little intimidated by the python languange but I am definitely understanding it more and more. I also think having the knowledge of coding in AP CSP has helped me a lot. I do feel as thoguht pything may get harder but I think I'll figure it out as we go on.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Some differences are you don't necessarily need parenthesis after functions for the code to work while in javascript you did, also another difference is how important indentations are in python but in javascript you could writ the code all in the same row and the code would run. The final difference I noticed was when doing AND and OR you don't need the lines like "||" or "&" you can just write the word. The similiarties are the functions seem closely similar to me and overall way the purpose of some codes works like returns, for-statements, if-statments, and so on.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned mostly porblem-solving, for example when I was iven a porblem I was able to somewhat think the problem do and get a basic idea of what types of code I needed before attempting the problem, I also learned just basic uses of the coding language python, and what makes it not work which is indentation, that is very important to the code. I also learned how to manipulate lists and different little aspects of them like adding every element, printing every element, and such, these are little things that didn't really make sense to me in AP CSP that are beginging to become more clear to me now.
